# G-code Data Extraction Script

## Overview
This script is a rough outline I used to get familiar with Python. It would be easy to extend this into a full 3D print job manager by adding features such as job tracking, analytics, and database storage.

This Python script extracts critical 3D printing parameters from G-code files generated by either Cura or Prusa slicer software. The extracted data includes:
- Bed Temperature
- Hotend Temperature
- Estimated Print Time
- Filament Used

## Features
- Compatible with Cura and Prusa slicers.
- Parses G-code files to extract key printing parameters.
- Simple command-line interface for user input.


## Usage
### Example Run
```
Gcode File Path: /path/to/your/file.gcode
Slicer Software (Cura or Prusa): Cura
```

### Output Example
```
Bed Temperature: 60°C
Hotend Temperature: 200°C
Estimated Print Time: 3h 45m
Filament Used: 1200 mm
```

## Script Explanation
1. **File Reading:**
    - Opens and reads the G-code file line by line.
2. **Keyword Selection:**
    - Sets appropriate keywords based on the slicer software:
      - Cura:
        - `;TIME_ELAPSED:` (Time keyword)
        - `;Filament used:` (Filament keyword)
      - Prusa:
        - `; estimated printing time (normal mode) =` (Time keyword)
        - `; filament used [mm] =` (Filament keyword)
3. **Data Extraction:**
    - Searches for keywords in the file and extracts corresponding values.
4. **Output:**
    - Displays extracted values in a readable format.
5. **Input Validation:**
    - Ensures the user inputs a valid slicer name.
    - No file testing.

## Performance Considerations
- The script processes the file in O(n) time complexity, making it efficient for large G-code files.
